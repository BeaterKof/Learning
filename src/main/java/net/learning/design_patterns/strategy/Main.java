/*
    In Strategy pattern, a class behavior or its algorithm can be changed at run time.
    This type of design pattern comes under behavior pattern.

    In Strategy pattern, we create objects which represent various strategies and a context object whose behavior
    varies as per its strategy object. The strategy object changes the executing algorithm of the context object.
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
      We could have used composition to create instance variable for strategies but we should avoid that as we want the
    specific strategy to be applied for a particular task, same is followed in Collections.sort() and Arrays.sort()
    method that take comparator as argument.

    Strategy Pattern is very similar to State Pattern. One of the difference is that Context contains state as instance
    variable and there can be multiple tasks whose implementation can be dependent on the state whereas in strategy pattern
    strategy is passed as argument to the method and context object doesnâ€™t have any variable to store it.

    Strategy pattern is useful when we have multiple algorithms for specific task and we want our application to be
     flexible to chose any of the algorithm at runtime for specific task.
